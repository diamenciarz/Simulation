This is a team project we worked on for a course "Simulation and Statistical Analysis".
In it, we simulate a Poisson process of a group of ambulances being called to random locations on a hexagonal map.
Once they arrive on site, they pick a patient up taking up a random amount of time following an exponential distribution.
The project measures the performance of the system over a long run.
